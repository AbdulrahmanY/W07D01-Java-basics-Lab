# Java Basics Lab

## Task1: Rock, Paper and Scissors
Follow these steps:
* Create a new file called rockPaperScissors.java

* Write a program that allows the user to play rock, paper, scissors.

* The program should randomly generate a number (0, 1 or 2), which represents scissors, rock and paper, respectively. (Hint: look up
Math.random)

* The program should then prompt the user to enter a number (0, 1 or 2).

* Once the user has entered their number, the program should inform them whether they win, lose or draw.

* The rules of the game are as follows:
    * Scissors beats paper
    * Rock beats scissors
    * Paper beats rock


## Task2: Average of numbers 
Follow these steps:
* Create a new file called averageNumber.java

* Write a program that determines how many positive and negative integers have been entered and calculates the total and average of all the entered numbers.

* Firstly, ask the user to enter any number of integers. The user should enter 0 to indicate the end of their input.

* The program should then determine the number of positive and negative integers entered by the user, and print out the result.

* The total of all integers entered as well as the average should then be calculated and displayed.
